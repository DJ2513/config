# My Personal configuration for Nvim
Hey there, here is my personal configuration I use for NeoVim whenever I jump into it. I followed a tutorial on YT on how to configure some of the basics and I have been tweeking it every now and then. Hope it helps you out!

## How to install it

First you need to install **Node JS** or **NVM** for my preference.

```bash
# For MacOS users
brew install nvm


# For Linux Users (Arc)
sudo pacman -S nvm
```

After this step is complete you just need to clone the code into your `~/.config/nvim` folder and that is it!
Hope you enjoy it!
